"@types/react-beautiful-dnd": "^13.1.8"  // TypeScript definitions
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating Multiple Charts
```text
User: "Show me comprehensive analysis of sales data with multiple visualizations"
AI: [Generates distribution charts, correlations, trends, and comparisons]
```

### Sending Charts to Dashboard
1. Generate charts in chat interface
2. Click "Send All to Dashboard" button
3. Navigate to Visualizations tab
4. Arrange charts in custom layout
5. Export dashboard for presentations

### Navigating Analysis History
1. Go to Analysis tab
2. View history sidebar with all past analyses
3. Click on any previous analysis to review
4. Use Previous/Next buttons to navigate chronologically

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
No new environment variables required. All features work with existing configuration.

### Docker Support
All enhancements are fully compatible with Docker deployment:
```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Real-time Collaboration**: Share dashboards with team members
2. **Chart Templates**: Save chart configurations for reuse
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter history by date range, user, or data source
4. **Export Formats**: Add Excel, PowerPoint export options
5. **Chart Annotations**: Add notes and insights directly on charts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Charts not displaying**
   - Ensure Plotly is properly loaded in frontend
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify data format from backend

2. **PDF generation fails**
   - Install reportlab: `pip install reportlab`
   - Check logs for specific errors
   - HTML fallback will be used automatically

3. **Drag-and-drop not working**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Ensure react-beautiful-dnd is installed
   - Check for JavaScript errors

## Performance Considerations

- Multiple charts are generated asynchronously
- Chart data is cached in Redux store
- History limited to 50 items to maintain performance
- Large datasets are paginated in tables

## Security Notes

- All chart data is processed server-side
- No sensitive data stored in browser localStorage
- Export functions respect user permissions
- Database connections remain secure

---

## Summary

These enhancements significantly improve the data analysis workflow by providing:
- **Better Visualization**: Multiple chart types for comprehensive analysis
- **Organization**: Dashboard for managing and arranging visualizations
- **History**: Track and revisit all previous analyses
- **Reliability**: Robust report generation with multiple fallbacks
- **User Experience**: Intuitive interface for non-technical users

The application now offers a complete data analysis suite with enterprise-grade features while maintaining ease of use.
